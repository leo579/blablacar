# blablacar
This project is designed to find consecutive BlaBlaCar options from one location to another, particularly in areas with limited options. To run it, follow these steps:

    Open the main file.
    Change the parameters according to your desired values.
    Obtain a BlaBlaCar API key.
    Run the program.

Upon execution, the program will automatically display some possible trips. Keep in mind that not all trips may be feasible due to factors such as inadequate public transportation options between two consecutive BlaBlaCars or insufficient time between them. This tool serves as a means to identify potential candidates for your journey.
